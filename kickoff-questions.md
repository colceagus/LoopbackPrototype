Kick-Off Questions

Authentication/Authorization: 
	- How is the Authentication handled in the Architecture ? Same Server / Separate User Authentication Server.
	- Are we going to use Token or Session based Authentication ? How are we going to handle it (the authentication method: session/token) ?
	- Are we going to use Bearer Tokens? 
	- Using Caching or not ?
